Enhancing Article Summarization Using Abstractive Meta-Learning  

This project implements an abstractive text summarization model using **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)** to improve summarization accuracy with minimal data. The model fine-tunes deep learning techniques to enhance domain adaptability and improve evaluation metrics.

Features  
- Abstractive Summarization: Generates human-like summaries rather than extracting sentences.  
- Meta-Learning (MAML): Allows quick adaptation to new datasets with minimal training data.  
- Evaluation with ROUGE Metrics: Measures performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Optimized for Computational Efficiency: Delivers high accuracy with reduced resource consumption.  

 Technologies Used  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning 
- Meta-Learning (MAML)
- Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers)  
- ROUGE Metrics for Evaluation  
- Data Preprocessing & Model Optimization 

 Installation
